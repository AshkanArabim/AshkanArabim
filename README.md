Hello! I'm Ashkan!

I'm currently studying CS at the University of Texas at El Paso. 

On the research side, I have a bunch of experience using TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, among other libraries.

On the software development side, I know Python (of course), Java, C, JavaScript, React.JS, Vala, and a bit of C++. Honestly you'd be much better off looking at my resume in the "resume" repository. 

My interests tend to shift, I started in web development, shifted into data science, and now I'm focusing on contributing to open-source software.

You can see all the ways to reach out on my [portfolio](https://ashkan.zone). I'd be happy even if you just say hello :)
